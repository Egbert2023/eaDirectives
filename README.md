# eaDirectives
The application contains some directives for AngularJs that can be used for your own applications

Directives for AngularJs
1. eaMaskCode
2. eaAccordeon
3. eaLoadParams - 
4. eaNivi - 
5. eaImgBox - 
6. eaCookies - 
7. eaPathLink - 

## eaMaskCode
The directive is an aid to displaying code as developers expect it to. You can put the e.g. Html code 'any-html-code' into the tag:
``html
 <ea-mask-code ea-mask-html>
    any-html-code
 </ea-mask-code>
'''
The attribut "ea-mask-[type]" in the tag can use different values.
- html - for Html code
- js - for JavaScript code
- json - for JSON file
- css - for CSS file

The attribute ea-mask-[type] is an additional directive that adds exactly one function 'rowChange(row)' to the current scope of directive 'eaMaskCode'. This function implements the necessary adjustments for the selected code type.

If you need other code conversions than the existing ones, this can be done by additional your own directives.
Look at the examples and create your own directive (e.g. emmaMaskPhp). In order to integrate this directive, the corresponding file must be integrated in the index.html
```html
<script src="app/directive/emmaMaskPhp.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```
and the directive must be declared in the app.js file.
```javascript
eaDir.directive('emmaMaskPhp', [emmaMaskPhp]).$inject = ['$scope'];
```
Now you can add your directive as a new attribute in the tag
```html
<ea-mask-code emma-mask-php="emma-mask-php">
...php code ...
<\ea-mask-code>
```
## eaAccordeon
The accordion functionality consists of two directives. One shell and any sections. The shell <ea-acc-coat ...> set the title in a 'h1' tag. The sections <ea-acc-key ...> set subtitles in a 'h2' tag and set a limit to display text in the collapsed state.
You can call this directive as follows:
```html
<ea-acc-coat data-acc-title="Example of accordeon">
 <ea-acc-key data-title="Sub title 1 of accordeon" data-txt-len="20">
 --- Html code for the first section ---
 </ea-acc-key>
 <ea-acc-key data-title="Sub title 2 of accordeon" data-txt-len="10">
 --- Html code for the second section ---
 </ea-acc-key>
 <ea-acc-key data-title="Sub title n-th of accordeon" data-txt-len="10">
  <div class="row">
   <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">First col</div>
   <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">Second col</div>
   <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">Third col</div>
  </div>
 </ea-acc-key>
</ea-acc-coat>
```

## eaPathLink
The eaPathLink functionality is automatically used at the beginning of each HTML page
The WebInfo application uses this directive when calling up the Html pages in the menu in a parameterized manner as TemplateUrl
'computed.html'.
```html
<div class="eaCard">
  <ea-path-link></ea-path-link>
  <div class="eaContent">
    <div ea-add-html = "âŸ¨{url}}"></div>
  </div>
</div>
```
You can see the result in this application at the top of every html page.

## eaNavi
This directive has the task of creating the complete menu and also provides a generated sitemap.

To ensure the functionality, it is necessary to fill the internal object 'naviList' before the menu is created. This can be achieved by firing an event that the process is waiting for after the corresponding JSON file has been successfully loaded. Or you fill the object in the JavaScript code yourself. Within my application I read all JSON files with the "eaLoadJson" directive. This fires the event "LoadJsonFile-naviList" after the file has been successfully loaded.

## eaAddHtml
This directive integrates another html page into an existing one. It is used in the parameterization of the angular routing mechanism. But it can also be used within your own application.
### Applay the functionality
We add the page "Example of dirPathLink".
The call is as follow:
```html
<div ea-add-html = "content/html/dirPathLink.html"></div>
```
## eaLoadJson
With the following call in the index.html file, all 5 Json files are read and fill there into the objects with the same name on $rootScope.

**Notice:**
```
When rendering Html tags handled by AngularJs it is advisable to mask the tags. Without a mask,
they are manipulated by Angular before they are displayed. It is sufficient to use the code "&lt;"
instead of the sign "<".
```

```html
<ea-load-json
   data-content-folder="content"
   data-json-folder="json"
   data-json-files="naviList, paramsApp, objBg, imgBoxList, newsList">
</ea-load-json>
```
Since reading the Json files is an asynchronous call, it must be ensured for safe further processing that the corresponding objects are also filled.
When the list [?] is loaded, a parameter $rootScope.isLoaded_[?] is set to 'true'
and an event "LoadJsonFile-[?]" is fired. You can whait for finish the loading by the call e.g. for the file "naviList":
```javascript
$rootScope.$on("LoadJsonFile-naviList", function(evt, opt) {
   $scope.naviList = $rootScope.naviList;
});
```
