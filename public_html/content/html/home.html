    <h1>
        Website with examples of my directives
    </h1>
    
    <p>
        In this small application, I list all AngularJs directives that I have written.
        These are freely available to everyone if you name the source.
        The directives are written in such a way that they can all be used independently. 
    </p>
    <p>
        An example application that uses all directives is my 
        <a class="eaExtern" target="_blank" href="http://aleksander.de" >my home page (WebInfo)</a>. 
        
    </p>
    <p>
        The entire code of this application or my homepage is available on GitHub.
        <a class="eaExtern" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Egbert2023/" >Code on GitHub</a>
        On my home page I modified some directives to avoid multiple function 
        definitions. For this purpose, I have defined a service that bundles 
        functions that are used multiple times.

        <i class="bi bi-cone-striped" style="font-size: 1.6rem; color: red;"></i>
        At the moment the directives are in an adjustment process in order to be able to use each one separately.
