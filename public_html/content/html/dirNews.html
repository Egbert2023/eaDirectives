The news mechanism is used to automatically generate a list of news. This is 
provided with a date validity range and can, for example, make predefined 
messages available on a time-controlled basis. On the other hand, messages 
can be automatically moved to the archive when the time is up.
<br />The news is displayed in the same way as with the accordion directive.
<br /> The news directive can be embedded in any HTML page. Depending on the use, 
different parameters are supported.
                <ea-mask-code ea-mask-html>
&lt;ea-news data-news-title="All my news"
    data-news-mode="new"
    data-news-limit="2"
    data-news-txt-len="200"
    data-news-init-idx="0"
&lt;/ea-news>    
                </ea-mask-code>
The parameters have the following effect. The first "data-news-title" is the 
heading and is displayed with the h1 tag.
<br />The second "data-news-mode" can assume the following values.
                <ul>
                    <li>all - all entries for which the date 'newFrom' has been reached are displayed, regardless of the date 'newTo'.</li>
                    <li>new - all entries are displayed for which the date 'newFrom' has been reached and 'newTo' has not yet passed.</li>
                    <li>arc - all entries are displayed for which the date 'newFrom' has been reached and 'newTo' has already passed.</li>
                </ul>
The "data-news-limit" parameter determines the maximum number of news to be 
displayed if more news meet the criteria for display than are desired at the 
relevant point. (This can be of interest for a home page, for example.)
<br />
The parameter "data-news-txt-len" limits the number of characters displayed in 
the collapsed state. If this value is 0, no preview text is displayed.
<br />The parameter "data-news-init-idx" indicates which New is initially 
expanded. If the value is 0, no New initial is opened.

                <div class='alert alert-info'>
                    <strong>Note:</strong>
In order to display all entries recorded in the news JSON file, the author must 
ensure that either the 'all' mode is used on at least one HTML page or that 
'new' and 'arc' are used on two pages without restriction ('data -news-limit') 
is selected.

The values ​​from the JSON file are processed according to the following rule:
                <ul>
                    <li>If both fields "body" and "img" are specified, the display will 
                        automatically have two columns.</li>
                    <li>If only one of the two fields is specified, it is displayed in one 
                        column.</li>
                    <li>The "imgBody" field is always displayed as a caption.</li>
                    <li>If none of the two fields "body" and "img" are specified, this part of 
                        the display is suppressed. Then there should be an "href" entry.</li>
                    <li>In the "href" field, an optional HTML page can be specified, which is 
                        attached to the part defined above. This may be necessary if, for 
                        example, a link is to be displayed. Html code cannot be displayed in 
                        the "body" field, only format-free text can be used here.</li>
