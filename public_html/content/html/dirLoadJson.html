<div>
    <h1>eaLoadJson</h1>
With the following call in the index.html file, all 5 Json files are read 
and fill there into the objects with the same name on $rootScope.
    <br /><br />
    <div class='alert alert-info'>
<strong>Notice:</strong> When rendering Html tags handled by AngularJs it is 
advisable to mask the tags. 
Without a mask, they are manipulated by Angular before they are displayed. 
It is sufficient to use the code "&amp;lt;" instead of the sign "<".
    </div>
    <ea-mask-code ea-mask-html>            
&lt;ea-load-json   
    data-content-folder="content"                    
    data-json-folder="json"                    
    data-json-files="naviList, paramsApp, objBg, imgBoxList, newsList">
&lt;/ea-load-json>        
    </ea-mask-code>
    <br />
Since reading the Json files is an asynchronous call, it must be ensured for safe further processing that the corresponding objects are also filled.
    <br />
When the list [?] is loaded, a parameter $rootScope.isLoaded_[?] is set to 'true' 
    <br />
and an event "LoadJsonFile-[?]" is fired. You can whait for finish the loading 
by the call e.g. for the file "naviList":
    <ea-mask-code ea-mask-js>
$rootScope.$on("LoadJsonFile-naviList", function(evt, opt) {
    $scope.naviList = $rootScope.naviList;
});
    </ea-mask-code>

</div>
