    <h1>eaLoadJson</h1>
    With the following call in the index.html file, all 5 Json files are read and created in the objects with the same name.

      When rendering Html tags handled by AngularJs it is advisable to mask the tags. 
      Without a mask, they are manipulated by Angular before they are displayed. 
      It is sufficient to use the code "&amp;lt;" instead of the "<" characters. used.
    </div>
    <ea-mask-code data-code-type="html">            
&lt;ea-load-json   
    data-content-folder="content"                    
    data-json-folder="json"                    
    data-json-files="naviList, paramsApp, objBg, imgBoxList, newsList">
&lt;/ea-load-json>        
    </ea-mask-code>
    <br />
    Since reading the Json files is an asynchronous call, it must be ensured for safe further processing that the corresponding objects are also filled.
    <br />
    When the list [?] is loaded, a parameter $rootScope.isLoaded_[?] is set to 'true' 
    <br />
    and an event "LoadJsonFile-[?]" is fired.
