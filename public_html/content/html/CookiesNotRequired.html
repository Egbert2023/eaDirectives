    This means that neither so-called "technically necessary cookies", no external cookies (e.g. as with Facebook-Like and the like) nor "tracking cookies" (e.g. as with Google Analytics) are set or read on this website.
    The only exception is the dirCookies demo page. Here the cookies can be switched on and off again explicitly for demo purposes.

    External links are marked red, bold and underlined. E.g.: <a class="eaExtern" target="_blank" href="">www.externerLink.de</a>
    If you click on such an external link that leaves your own web application, it will happen in most cases that the respective providers in turn use cookies. 
    The website operator has no influence on this. Please note that you can then receive and edit the corresponding cookie banners to adapt them to your needs, if necessary, in order to protect your privacy.
